# Renewable Energy Dashboard with MS Excel

The official website of the International Renewable Energy Agency provides access to data on the production of electricity from renewable and non-renewable sources by member countries for the period from 2010 to 2020. 

The analysis of these data consisted of the following steps:

* Working in the Query Editor to prepare the dataset
* Summarising the dataset with PivotTables
* Performing calculations for specific indicators 
* Visually representing data with PivotCharts and conditional formatting 
* Adding charts to dashboard with style and customisability

The analysis resulted in a comparison of the amount of energy produced from alternative energy sources for different countries and regions, as well as an assessment of the potential for increasing the share of renewable sources in the energy mix.
